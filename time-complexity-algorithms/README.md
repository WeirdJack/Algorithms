## TIme Complexity Algorithm

### problem-definition

```
1. Given a sorted list of distinct integers A[1], A[2],...,A[n], 
you want to find out whether there is
an index i for which A[i] = i. Give an algorithm that runs in time O(log n).

2. Consider the problem of making change for n cents using the fewest number of coins. 
Assume that each coinâ€™s value is an integer.

Give an O(nk) time algorithm that makes change for any set of k different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny.
