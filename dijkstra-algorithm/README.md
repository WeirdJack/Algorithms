Dijkstra Algorithm

``
problem-definition

``

```
Consider a graph of V vertices and E edges. One standard way to input a graph is to use an adjacency matrix. The matrix is of size V*V. The value of the (i,j)th entry (i.e., ith row and jth column) denotes the edge weight between vertices i and j. If two vertices have no edges between them, then assign the edge weight to a large number. For this assignment, your program should be able to print out a table (exactly similar to the one taught in class) demonstrating the running of Dijkstra’s algorithm. The program should be able to take as input (i.e., source) any vertex in the graph and then output the above table. Please use the graph provided in question 1 of the written part as reference.
