## Selection Sort Algorithm

### problem-definition

```
In the first part of the problem you will implement the simple selection sort algorithm. 
You can use an array to store the elements.

a. As you are aware the selection sort algorithm runs in O(n^2) time. 
Implement your algorithm in a separate function called SelectionSort().

Sample Test Cases

Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 Output: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 22
b. In the second part of the assignment you will modify the selection sort algorithm 
to obtain the first k smallest elements of the array in sorted order (the value of k will be entered by the user). 
Your algorithm must run in O(nk) time.

Sample Test Case 1

Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 k= 4
Output: 2, 3, 4, 6

Sample Test Case 2

Input: 4, 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 10, 3, 9, 2 k= 6
Output: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

c. Use the implementation in part 2 to determine the median value of the input array. 
You can assume that the values in the array are distinct. 
If the array is of even size, then the median is the average of the two middle values is the array.
```

### instructions

```
This program will ask the user for inputs

1. Size of array

2. Elements of the array

It will sort an array using selection sort

3. It will ask the user for entering the value of k

It will produce a sorted array of length k with smallest elements

4. It will produce the median of the sorted array of length k
